# gas-leak-detection\

Gas leak detection using Arduino involves connecting a gas sensor module to an Arduino board. 
The sensor module is calibrated to detect specific gases, and a threshold is set to identify gas leaks. 
When the gas concentration exceeds the threshold, an alert mechanism is triggered, such as an LED, alarm, or notification. 
Safety precautions should be followed, and the system can be customized based on the sensor module and project requirements.
